# Warm Lambda Test

This project contains a bunch of files that are to be used to test how long AWS Lambda waits until it shuts down a container. The intervals range from 1-15, and then jump to 30, 45, and 60.

Results and a description of how all of this works can be found [here](https://medium.com/@SamCorcos/how-to-keep-your-lambda-functions-warm-9d7e1aa6e2f0).
